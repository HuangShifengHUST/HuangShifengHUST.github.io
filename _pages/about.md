- Machine learning and deep learning technologies have recently been successfully employed in many complicated high-stake decision-making applications. The goal of Xcurve learning is to learn high-quality models that can adapt to different decision conditions, which provides a systematic solution to optimize the area under different kinds of performance curves.
