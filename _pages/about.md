*2020.02 - now*: &nbsp; **<font color='red'> As a core member, </font>** I participated in the development of [XCurve: Machine Learning with Decision-Invariant Metrics](https://github.com/statusrank/XCurve). 

- Machine learning and deep learning technologies have recently been successfully employed in many complicated high-stake decision-making applications. The goal of Xcurve learning is to learn high-quality models that can adapt to different decision conditions, which provides a systematic solution to optimize the area under different kinds of performance curves.

XCurve focuses on **the design criteria of the objective function for ML tasks**, which can be formulated as a series of X-metric (say AUROC, AUPRC, AUTKC) optimization problems considering the **average performance of all decision thresholds** during the training phase.
